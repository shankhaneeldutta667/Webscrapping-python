# Webscrapping-python

Webscrapping is a process of extracting data from the websites through various methods.
This technique is useful ,if someone wishes to analyze some data from the website

          - I have use Python(3.10) to scrap the information from websites
          - As we know most of the websites are written with HTML, it is necessary to parse the HTML file while writing our codes
          - I have used three modules that come in-built with Python(3.10.8) : bs4,requests,openpyxl
